# OracleFunctions-getStarted
Learn how to work with Oracle Functions

In this tutorial, you use an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account to set up Oracle Functions development using Cloud Shell. Then, we create a function application and a function. Key tasks include how to:

Set up an authentication token.
Gather required information.
Set up a VCN.
Log in to OCI Registry (OCIR).
Configure Cloud Shell to deploy functions.
Configure your Fn context.
Create an app for your Oracle function.
Create a function.
Deploy your function.
Test your function.

Before You Begin

To successfully perform this tutorial, we must have the following:

A paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account. See Signing Up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Link- https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingup.htm
Your OCI account configured to support Oracle Functions development. See Create Policy for Oracle Functions.
https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/infographics/oci_functions_cloudshell_quickview/functions_quickview_top/functions_quickview/index.html#

OCI CLI
Docker
Python 3.6+
Java 1.8+

1.Gather Required Information

Collect all the information needed to complete the tutorial.

Gather Region and Registry Information
Prepare the information we need from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

Find your region identifier and region key from Regions and Availability Domains.
Example: us-ashburn-1 and iad for Ashburn.
https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm

Create a registry project name to store our function images in OCI Registry (OCIR).
When we publish a function, a Docker image is created in OCIR. Your OCIR project name is prepended to our function images to make them easy to find. For example, given:

Registry project name: my-func-prj
Function name: node-func
Your function image would be stored on OCIR under: my-func-prj/node-func

Get Compartment, Auth Token, and Collect your Data

Create or Select a Compartment
https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#To

To create a compartment see Create a compartment. After our compartment is created, save the compartment OCID.

To get the compartment OCID from an existing compartment:

Go to Identity then Compartments.
Select your compartment.
Click the Copy link for the OCID field.

Create an Authorization Token
We create an authorization token to log in to the OCI Registry. To create an authorization token:

In the top navigation bar, click your user avatar.
Select your username.
Click Auth Tokens.
Click Generate Token.
Give it a description.
Click Generate Token.
Copy the token and save it.

Collect our Information

Collect all the information needed to complete the tutorial. Copy the following information into your notepad.

Region: <region-identifier>
Example: ap-mumbai-1.

Region Key: <region-key>
Example: bom.

Registry Project Name: <your-project-name>
Example: my-func-prj.

Compartment ID: <compartment-id>
Example: ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa2nmz2tuisdthmpeisu6ubjsenbvabvuzxigxst4vbzrnsp7i4csq

Auth Token: <auth-token>
Example: 3:0y1BF2Jj+;s_<sn]fE

Tenancy name: <tenancy-name>
From your user avatar, example: tcsbangalore2

Tenancy OCID: <tenancy-ocid>
From your user avatar, go to Tenancy: <your-tenancy> and copy OCID, example: ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaonu3r4bfkxpkccywutzd4ekmzt3ys4krlrojg25ixuwd3oxhliya

Username: <user-name>
From your user avatar.
Eg: oracleidentitycloudservice/Saikat

Note: For a user with admin access the username would be like: saikatdey

2.Create your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)

1. From the main landing page, select Set up a network with a wizard.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42166489/107511307-4ed44780-6bcb-11eb-938c-d5c794f4ae9f.png)

2. In the Start VCN Wizard workflow, select VCN with Internet Connectivity and then click Start VCN Wizard .
3. In the configuration dialog, fill in the VCN Name for our VCN. Our Compartment is already set to its default value of <our-tenancy> (root).
4. In the Configure VCN and Subnets section, keep the default values for the CIDR blocks:
VCN CIDR BLOCK: 10.0.0.0/16
PUBLIC SUBNET CIDR BLOCK: 10.0.0.0/24
PRIVATE SUBNET CIDR BLOCK: 10.0.1.0/24

5. For DNS RESOLUTION uncheck USE DNS HOSTNAMES IN THIS VCN.Picture shows the USE DNS HOSTNAMES IN THIS VCN option is unchecked.
Click Next.
6. The Create a VCN with Internet Connectivity configuration dialog is displayed (not shown here) confirming all the values our just entered.

7. Click Create to create our VCN.
The Creating Resources dialog is displayed (not shown here) showing all VCN components being created.

8. Click View Virtual Cloud Network to view our new VCN.
Our new VCN is displayed. Now we need to add a security rule to allow HTTP connections on port 3000, the default port for our application.

9. With our new VCN displayed, click our Public subnet link.
The public subnet information is displayed with the Security Lists at the bottom of the page. There should be a link to the Default Security List for our VCN.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42166489/107511378-67dcf880-6bcb-11eb-9bfd-7ac72f4a7107.png)

10. Click on the Default Security List link.
The default Ingress Rules for our VCN are displayed.

11. Click Add Ingress Rules.
An Add Ingress Rules dialog is displayed.

12. Fill in the ingress rule with the following information. Once all the data is entered, click Add Ingress Rules.
Fill in the ingress rule as follows:

Stateless: Checked
Source Type: CIDR
Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
IP Protocol: TCP
Source port range: (leave-blank)
Destination Port Range: 3000
Description: VCN for applications
Once we click Add Ingress Rule, HTTP connections are allowed to our public subnet.

3.Log into the OCI Registry

Next, you log Docker into the OCI Registry (OCIR).

Log your Docker into OCIR
Get the information you gathered earlier.
Open a terminal window.
Log in to OCIR:

docker login <region-key>.ocir.io
You are prompted for your login name and password.

Username: <tenancy-name>/<user-name>
Password: <auth-token>

In Cloud Shell:
sudo docker login ap-mumbai-1.ocir.io
bmdrgwy1wsjh/oracleidentitycloudservice/Saikat
3:0y1BF2Jj+;s_<sn]fE
You have logged your instance into OCIR.

4. Configure Functions

To use Oracle Functions, we must configure the Fn application context. The context stores the values needed to connect to the Oracle Functions service. Fn client commands are used to add the required configuration data.

Configure the Fn Context for the Cloud Shell
We need the information you gathered from earlier on. Use Fn client commands to configure Fn.

Open your Cloud Shell instance.
Get a list of Fn contexts.
fn list context

We see contexts for default and <your-region-identifier>.

Select the context named with <your-region-identifier>.
For example: fn use context us-phoenix-1

List the Fn contexts to ensure <our-region-identifier> is selected. (Has a star next to it.)
Set the compartment for Oracle Functions.
Example: fn update context oracle.compartment-id ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaarvdfa72n...

Set the URL for our Registry repository.
Sample command:Â fn update context registry <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<registry-project-name>

Example: fn update context registry phx.ocir.io/my-tenancy/my-func-prj
